        <h3>Certified Software Engineer</h3>
        <p>
          I have mastered the Software Development Life Cycle and I am highly
          interested in building robust software using current Agile approaches,
          especially Scrum. When working on Web projects I use the MERN, LAMP,
          WAMP or Django Web stacks. I am very passionate about everything to do
          with Software Engineering and Innovative Technology, always eager to
          create or acquire new knowledge, skills and competencies in my trade.
          <br /><br />
          I am a good team player who is always ready to engage and work in
          collaboration with my colleagues to invent and bring long-term
          solutions to modern day problems. I believe Software Engineering is
          not just about writing clean code, but mostly about coming up with
          software solutions that are highly efficient within their context.
          Away from SE, I love sports and the arts. I find joy in local
          football, baseball and softball games, exploring good music, oral and
          written literature and interacting with magnificent works of art made
          by hand.
